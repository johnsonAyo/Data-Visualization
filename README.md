# Human Activity Recognition using Machine Learning

## CIS 4519 Data Mining and Visualaisation

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for recognizing human activities based on sensor data collected from a smartphone. The dataset used in this project is similar to the WISDM dataset, which includes accelerometer and gyroscope data from a Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone.

## Requirements

Python 3.7 or higher
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/data_mining.git`
2. Download the Wismd dataset
3. Unzip the dataset
4. Start running the Code Blocks

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
Accelerometer data (x, y, z axes)
Gyroscope data (x, y, z axes)
Activity labels (walking, jogging, sitting, standing,etc)
The raw sensor data was collected at a sampling rate of 20Hz and segmented into 10-second non-overlapping windows. From each window, statistical features were derived, such as mean, variance, standard deviation, and correlation between axes.
